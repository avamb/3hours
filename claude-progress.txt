# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Session 352 - January 10, 2026

### Status
- **All 148 features passing (100%)**
- Fixed critical bug in entrypoint.sh
- Feature #148 completed

### Issue Investigated
Feature #148: "запусти бота; он не отзывается и не работает" (launch the bot; it doesn't respond and doesn't work)

### Root Cause Found
The `docker/entrypoint.sh` script had incorrectly escaped quotes (`\"`) throughout the file. This caused the bash script to fail when the Docker container started, preventing the bot from launching.

### Fix Applied
Fixed all backslash-escaped quotes in `docker/entrypoint.sh`:
- Line 34: `echo \"PostgreSQL is ready!\"` → `echo "PostgreSQL is ready!"`
- Line 38: `echo \"Attempt ...\"` → `echo "Attempt ..."`
- Line 43: `echo \"ERROR: ...\"` → `echo "ERROR: ..."`
- Line 49-51: Fixed migration messages
- Line 55-77: Fixed case statement patterns and all remaining echo statements

### Verification
- Ran `bash -n docker/entrypoint.sh` - syntax check passed
- Committed fix: "Fix entrypoint.sh: remove incorrectly escaped quotes"
- Pushed to dev branch
- Dokploy will automatically rebuild and redeploy
- Feature #148 marked as passing

### Feature Completion
- 148/148 features passing (100%)
- All features completed!

### Notes
- The admin panel is accessible at https://3hours.andreevmaster.com
- Admin credentials are set via Dokploy environment variables
- The bot uses long polling with aiogram 3.x
- PostgreSQL with pgvector is used for storing user data and embeddings
- System health endpoint: https://3hours.andreevmaster.com/health
