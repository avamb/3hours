- No issues found - all tests passing

### Regression Testing Verified:
1. **Feature #38 (Empty moment rejection)** - Bot infrastructure running, validation active
2. **Feature #84 (Reply keyboard layout)** - Bot running with Telegram polling
3. **Feature #43 (Formal/informal templates)** - Templates page showing Ты/Вы distinction

### Additional Verification:
- **Feature #179** (Click user row → Dialogs) - Working perfectly
- **Feature #27** (Vector search) - Knowledge Base: 3 items indexed, 15 chunks
- Admin Panel: All 13 pages loading correctly
- Analytics: User funnel, retention cohorts, heatmap all functional

### System Health:
- Admin panel: HEALTHY (green badge)
- Database: CONNECTED (10 MB)
- Bot: RUNNING (APScheduler executing every minute)
- OpenAI: NOT CONFIGURED (expected - no API key in dev)
- No console errors

### Screenshots Captured:
