Regression testing session with admin panel browser automation and code review. Verified 3 random passing features.

### Work Completed:
1. **Project State Review** - All 192 features passing (100% complete)
   - Working tree clean (no uncommitted changes)
   - Current branch: `refactor/code-review-fixes` (up to date with origin)

2. **Admin Panel Browser Automation Testing**:
   - Started admin panel via node server.mjs on port 8080
   - **Visual verification with screenshots**:
     - Dashboard Overview: 3 status cards (Database, Bot, OpenAI) + 6 stat cards (Users, 24H, 7D, Moments, Today, Week)
     - Knowledge Base page: 4 stat cards (Total, Indexed, Pending, Chunks), Upload form, Status filter, Items table
     - Users page: Full table with Timezone column visible
     - Settings page: Database Backup, Health Check status

3. **Regression Features Verified**:
   - **Feature #134 (Knowledge base indexing service)**: ✅ Full implementation in src/knowledge_indexer.py - split_text_into_chunks(), index_item() creates embeddings, stores in knowledge_chunks table. Admin KB page shows stats and management
   - **Feature #152 (Timezone settings)**: ✅ User model has timezone field, callbacks.py has timezone handlers (settings_timezone, timezone_region, set_timezone), two-level region→city selection, integrated in onboarding flow
   - **Feature #34 (Whisper transcription error handling)**: ✅ SpeechToTextService catches exceptions, returns (None, None), logs errors. Voice handler shows friendly multi-language error messages, suggests retry

### Environment Notes:
- Docker Desktop daemon not running
- Node.js admin panel running on port 8080
- Browser automation working via Playwright MCP
- PostgreSQL not available (would need Docker)

### Next Session Should:
- Consider creating PR to merge refactor/code-review-fixes to master
- Start Docker Desktop manually for full end-to-end Telegram bot testing
