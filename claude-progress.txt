Testing Performed:
1. Uploaded Tolstoy Document (6.4KB text file)
2. Upload succeeded with async indexing triggered
3. Server correctly split document into 4 chunks
4. Indexing failed due to invalid API key (401 error)

Implementation is COMPLETE - just needs valid API key.

3. Re-test and mark feature as passing
