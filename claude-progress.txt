## Session 90 - Verification Check (January 7, 2026)

### Status
- All 104 features are PASSING (100% complete)
- Bot is running and responding to users
- Database is properly storing data

### Verification Results
- Docker containers healthy: PostgreSQL and Bot both running
- Database tables exist with proper schema
- pgvector extension enabled
- Notification scheduler running (every minute checks)
- Real user interactions observed in logs:
  - User completed onboarding
  - User changed notification interval settings
  - All updates handled successfully (90-325ms response times)

### Notes
- Early boot errors (relation "users" does not exist) were transient - the bot was starting before migrations completed
- Docker restart policy handled this correctly by retrying until database was ready
- No code changes required this session

## Session 89 - Critical Bug Fix (January 7, 2026)

### Status
- All 104 features are PASSING (100% complete)
- CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Bot was crashing on startup

### Bug Fixed This Session
**SQLAlchemy Reserved Attribute Name Error:**
- Error: `Attribute name 'metadata' is reserved when using the Declarative API`
- Root cause: Conversation model used `metadata` as attribute name (reserved by SQLAlchemy)
- Fix: Renamed to `message_metadata` with column name mapping to preserve DB schema
- Files changed: `src/db/models/conversation.py`, `src/services/gdpr_service.py`

### Bot Status
- PostgreSQL container: Healthy
- Bot container: Running successfully
- Notification scheduler: Active
- Telegram polling: Active (@MindSetHappyBot)
