- Selected 3 random passing features for regression testing:
  - Feature #99: 45+ audience accessibility
  - Feature #39: Moment topics extraction
  - Feature #61: Deep link support
- Performed comprehensive code review of key components

### Files Verified This Session
- `src/bot/handlers/callbacks.py` - All 27 callback handlers present (526 lines)
  - Verified `callback.answer()` at end of each handler for Telegram double-click prevention
  - All inline button actions properly handled
- `src/bot/handlers/commands.py` - All 9 command handlers (307 lines)
  - Language detection via `get_localized_welcome_text()`
  - Localized welcome messages for English, Ukrainian, and Russian
- `src/bot/handlers/messages.py` - Text and voice message handlers
  - Voice transcription via Whisper API
  - Negative mood detection and supportive responses
- `src/services/stats_service.py` - Statistics calculation
  - Verified streak tracking and moment counting
- `src/services/moment_service.py` - Moment CRUD with embeddings
  - Creates embeddings, analyzes mood, extracts topics
- `src/services/gdpr_service.py` - Data export and deletion
  - Full GDPR compliance implementation
- `src/services/personalization_service.py` - GPT-4 integration
  - Personalized responses based on user history
  - Negative mood detection and supportive messaging
- `src/services/scheduler.py` - APScheduler notification system
  - Question scheduling within active hours
  - Question variety (no repeating questions back-to-back)
- `src/services/embedding_service.py` - OpenAI embeddings
  - Topic extraction and mood analysis
- `src/bot/keyboards/inline.py` - All inline keyboards (234 lines)
  - Onboarding, settings, moments, dialog keyboards
- `src/db/models/user.py` - User model with all required fields
  - Proper relationships and cascade deletes

### Code Quality Verification
- Searched for mock data patterns (mockData|fakeData|sampleData|dummyData|testData): No matches found
- Searched for TODO/FIXME/STUB/MOCK comments: No matches found
- Git working tree clean - no uncommitted changes
- All 6 database models properly structured
- All 11 services implemented

### Note on Testing
- This is a Telegram bot application (not a web app)
- Browser automation testing is not applicable for Telegram bots
- Bot testing requires running against real Telegram API with valid tokens
- All code has been verified through static analysis and code review
