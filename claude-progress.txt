## Current Status: 176/176 features passing (100%) ✅ COMPLETE!

## Session 567 - January 13, 2025

### Regression Testing - All Systems Verified Working

Performed comprehensive regression testing to verify application stability:

**Components Verified:**
1. Dashboard Overview - HEALTHY status, all services connected (Database, Bot, OpenAI)
2. Knowledge Base - Full auto-indexing workflow tested:
   - Uploaded test document "Test Document Regression"
   - Verified status changed from "Pending" to "Indexed"
   - Document split into 4 chunks with embeddings
   - Successfully deleted test document after verification
3. Analytics - User funnel, retention cohorts, registration chart, activity heatmap all functional
4. Logs - System log viewer with filtering working
5. Bot container - Telegram bot polling, APScheduler running

**Infrastructure Status:**

- Bot polling Telegram API successfully (@Ai_HappyBot)
- APScheduler running notification jobs every minute
- OpenAI API key configured and working
- Zero console errors detected

## Session 565 - January 13, 2025

### Feature 176 - Auto-index Knowledge Base uploads - VERIFIED PASSING!

Root cause of previous blocker was that the Docker containers were using an old 
invalid API key. Restarting containers picked up the new key from .env.

## Previous Sessions Summary:
- Sessions 534-564: All blocked by invalid OpenAI API key (container had old key)
- Session 565: Identified root cause, restarted containers, verified all ACs passing
- Session 566: Regression testing confirmed all systems working
