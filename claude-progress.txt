# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Current Status: 161/161 features passing (100% complete)

## Session 435 - January 11, 2026

### Feature Implemented: #161 - Language Options
- **Problem**: Bot was responding in Russian when users wrote in English
- **Root Cause**: GPT system prompts were primarily in Russian, biasing responses
- **Solution**:
  - Created strong bilingual `LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTION` with highest priority markers
  - Placed language instruction at the TOP of all GPT system prompts
  - Made instructions bilingual (English + Russian) to avoid language bias
  - Updated all 4 methods in `personalization_service.py`:
    - `generate_response()` - for positive moment responses
    - `generate_supportive_response()` - for negative mood support
    - `generate_empathetic_response()` - for empathetic responses
    - `generate_dialog_response()` - for free dialog mode
  - Updated `summary_service.py` for weekly/monthly summaries
  - Updated `social_profile_service.py` for interest parsing
