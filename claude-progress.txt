# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Current Status: 175/176 features passing (99.4%)

## Session 539 - January 13, 2026

### Regression Testing Performed:
- Dashboard Overview: HEALTHY, Database CONNECTED (11 MB), Bot RUNNING, OpenAI CONFIGURED
- 10 Users, 23 Moments displayed correctly
- Recent activity showing bot questions and responses

### Feature #176 - Auto-index Knowledge Base uploads (Re-verification)

**Testing Performed:**
1. Uploaded TXT document "Test Auto-Indexing Document" with title, category, tags
2. Upload succeeded with message: "File uploaded successfully. Indexing will be processed." (AC8 ✅)
3. Status transitioned: pending → indexing → error (due to invalid API key)
4. Error stored in database with descriptive message

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**
| AC | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| AC5 | Short doc error | ✅ VERIFIED - Logs: "Document too short/empty (min 50 chars)" |
| AC6 | Large doc error | ✅ VERIFIED - Logs: "Document too large (max 120000 chars)" |
| AC7 | Max chunks limit | ✅ IMPLEMENTED (verified in code) |
| AC8 | Async upload response | ✅ VERIFIED - Green success message appears |
| AC9 | PDF rejection | ✅ VERIFIED - Logs: "PDF not supported yet" |
| AC1-4 | Full indexing flow | ⚠️ BLOCKED - Invalid OpenAI API key (401 error) |

**Implementation Verified:**
- Fire-and-forget async indexing on upload ✅
- Status transitions work correctly ✅
- Error handling with descriptive messages ✅
- All guardrails implemented (MIN_DOC_CHARS=50, MAX_DOC_CHARS=120000, MAX_CHUNKS=120) ✅
- Rate limiting between API calls ✅

**Blocking Issue (UNCHANGED from previous sessions):**
- OpenAI API key returns 401 "Incorrect API key provided"
- Error: `401 Incorrect API key provided: sk-proj-***W8cA`
- This is an EXTERNAL blocker - API key is invalid/expired
- Feature implementation is COMPLETE - just needs valid API key to verify AC1-4

**Test Data Cleaned Up:**
- Test document deleted from Knowledge Base
- Test file removed from filesystem

**Decision:**
- Feature #176 remains blocked due to external API key issue
- Cannot mark as passing without full indexing flow verification (AC1-4)
- 5 of 9 acceptance criteria verified passing
- All 175 other features remain stable

**Next Steps:**
- Obtain valid OpenAI API key to complete Feature #176 testing
- Once key is updated, test full indexing flow: pending → indexing → indexed
- Verify chunks_count > 0 and knowledge_chunks table populated

## Session 538 - January 13, 2026

### Regression Testing Performed:
Verified system stability before continuing with Feature #176:

1. **Dashboard Overview** ✅
   - HEALTHY status, Database CONNECTED (11 MB), Bot RUNNING, OpenAI CONFIGURED
   - 10 Users, 23 Moments, accurate statistics
   - Recent activity displaying correctly

2. **Users Page** ✅
   - 10 users with complete fields (ID, Telegram ID, Username, Name, Gender, Language, Moments, Streak, Last Active)
   - Search, filter (language/status), sort, Export CSV functionality

3. **Moments Page** ✅
   - 23 moments, 3 unique users, 0.56 avg mood
   - Topics Cloud with real extracted topics
   - Both text and voice source types verified

### Feature #176 - Auto-index Knowledge Base uploads (Re-verification)

**Testing Performed:**
- Uploaded valid TXT document → triggers async indexing ✅
- Status transition: pending → indexing → Error (due to API key) ✅
- Short document (<50 chars) → "Document too short/empty (min 50 chars)" error ✅
- PDF upload → "PDF not supported yet" error ✅
- Async upload response: "File uploaded successfully. Indexing will be processed." ✅
