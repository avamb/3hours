  - Scheduling respects active hours at lines 216-229
  - Questions only sent during user's configured active hours
- `src/bot/handlers/callbacks.py` - All 27 callback handlers (526 lines)
  - Individual moment deletion: lines 291-352
  - Confirmation dialog with moment preview
  - Actual deletion with user ownership verification
- `src/services/moment_service.py` - Moment CRUD with embeddings (234 lines)
  - delete_moment() at lines 189-216
