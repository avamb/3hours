## Current Status: 165/165 features passing (100% complete) 🎉

## Session 448 - January 11, 2026

### Feature #165 Implemented: Social Network Profile Parsing
- **Feature Name**: "Парсинг соцсетей" (Social Network Parsing)
- **Description**: Display error message when social network profile data cannot be parsed

### Implementation Details:
1. Added `attempt_parse_profile_data()` method to `social_profile_service.py`
   - Attempts to fetch profile data from social network URLs
   - Returns failure for most social networks (due to API restrictions)
   - Handles network errors, timeouts, and login page detection

2. Updated `add_social_link()` method:
   - Now returns 3 values: (success, message, profile_parse_failed)
   - Attempts profile parsing after saving the link
   - Link is saved even if parsing fails

3. Updated `handle_social_link_input()` in messages handler:
   - Shows localized warning when profile parsing fails
   - Uses `get_menu_text("social_parse_failed", language_code)`

4. Added localized error messages to `localization.py`:
   - Russian: "К сожалению, нам не удалось получить данные вашего профиля..."
   - English: "Unfortunately, we couldn't get your profile data..."
   - Ukrainian: "На жаль, нам не вдалося отримати дані вашого профілю..."
