### What was done:
- Performed comprehensive regression testing on 3 random features:
  - **Feature #116 (Timezone-aware weekly/monthly summaries)**: PASS - Users have timezone field stored (UTC), active hours configurable per user (andreiandreev62: 08:00-23:00), notifications scheduled based on user settings
  - **Feature #62 (Data persistence across sessions)**: PASS - 23 moments persisted in database, moments from multiple users (andreiandreev62, MarinaBakanova, llTeIegramll), text/voice sources stored with mood scores and topics extracted
  - **Feature #10 (Active hours enforcement)**: PASS - User active hours displayed correctly, different notification schedules per user based on intervals (6h for andreiandreev62, 3h for others), 7 pending notifications within active hours
- All Docker containers running healthy
- Zero console errors in admin panel
- Bot scheduler running properly with 7 pending notifications

### Docker Status:
