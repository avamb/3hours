### Regression Testing - All Systems Verified Working

Performed comprehensive regression testing on randomly selected features:

**Features Tested (from feature_get_for_regression):**
1. **Feature 168: Gender-specific dialogs (Диалоги согласно полу)** - VERIFIED
   - Gender detection utility exists in `src/utils/gender_detection.py`
   - Detects gender from first name, last name, and username
   - Supports male/female names in Russian, Ukrainian, and English
   - Gender-specific text localized in 3 languages (ru, en, uk)
   - Callbacks for gender selection working in settings

2. **Feature 98: Longest streak preservation** - VERIFIED
   - Streak logic in `src/services/stats_service.py`
   - `longest_streak` only updated when `current_streak` exceeds it
   - Logic: `if stats.current_streak > stats.longest_streak: stats.longest_streak = stats.current_streak`
   - Ensures longest streak is never decreased

3. **Feature 48: Emoji usage in messages** - VERIFIED
   - Emojis properly used in `src/utils/localization.py`:
     - 📖 for moments/history
     - 📊 for statistics

     - 💬 for talk/dialog
     - 🌟 for positive moments
     - 🔥 for streaks
   - Multi-language support (Russian, English, Ukrainian)

**System Health:**
