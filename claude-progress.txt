- OpenAI configured (API key set)
- APScheduler running notification jobs every minute successfully
- No console errors detected

### Random Features Verified (from feature_get_for_regression):

1. **Feature 55 (Embedding creation for moments)** - Verified:
   - Uploaded test document "TEST_REGRESSION_54321" via Knowledge Base UI
   - Auto-indexing worked correctly: pending -> indexing -> indexed
   - Verified in database: embedding IS NOT NULL = true
   - Verified embedding dimensions = 1536 (correct for OpenAI text-embedding-3-small)
   - Chunks created (1 chunk for small document)
   - Delete functionality cleaned up test data properly
   - Stats counters (Total, Indexed, Pending, Chunks) updated correctly

2. **Feature 124 (Weekly Summary feature)** - Verified via code review:
   - generate_weekly_summary() method fully implemented
