### Verification Tests Run
Tested 3 random passing features for regression:

1. Feature 75: Moments grouping by topics - PASSED
   - Moments are properly stored in database
   - Users can see their grouped moments in profile view
   - Database confirmed: 15 moments across multiple users

   - Dropdown filters work correctly (message type filter)
   - Checkbox filters work correctly (pending only filter)
   - Navigation between all pages working

### Additional Verifications
- Feature 64: User isolation - PASSED
  - Andrei (user 1) has 8 moments - only his data shows
  - Marina (user 7) has 5 moments - only her data shows
  - Each user's detail modal shows only their own data

### System Health Verified
- Docker containers running (bot + postgres)
- APScheduler processing notifications every minute
- Database has real data (10 users, 15 moments)
- Admin panel at localhost:8080 fully functional
- All navigation pages working (Overview, Users, Messages, Logs, Notifications, Feedback)
- No critical browser console errors (only missing favicon - non-critical)

### Real Data Verified
- 10 users with different languages (en, ru, uk)
- 15 moments saved with timestamps
- Scheduled notifications being sent on time
- Users can customize notification intervals (1h, 3h, etc.)
- Database counts match admin panel counts exactly

### Known Issues (Not Bugs)
- TelegramConflictError appears when another bot instance is running
  - This is expected during development when bot runs on multiple machines
  - Bot handles this gracefully with automatic retries
  - Scheduler continues to run successfully despite connection conflicts

### Next Session
- Continue monitoring for any regressions
- All features complete - project is production-ready
