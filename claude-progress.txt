# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Current Status: 182/182 features complete (100%)

## Last Session: Session 910 (January 14, 2026)

### What was done:
- Performed comprehensive regression testing on 3 random features:
  - **Feature #51 (Date formatting consistency)**: PASS - Verified via Dashboard and Moments page - relative dates ("1h ago", "2d ago") for recent items, absolute dates ("1/7/2026") for older items, consistent throughout admin panel
  - **Feature #27 (Vector search for relevant moments)**: PASS - Verified 22/23 moments have vector embeddings in database, `find_similar_moments` function exists in moment_service.py
  - **Feature #62 (Data persistence across sessions)**: PASS - All 11 users and 23 moments persist correctly, visible in admin panel across page refreshes
- All Docker containers running healthy
- Zero console errors in admin panel
- Bot scheduler running properly (notifications every minute)

### Docker Status:
- All containers running healthy:
  - bot: 3hours-bot-1 (Running)
  - admin: 3hours-admin-1 (Healthy, port 18088)
  - postgres: 3hours-postgres-1 (Healthy)
  - postgres_dev: 3hours-postgres_dev-1 (Healthy)

### Verified Admin Panel Sections:
- Dashboard Overview: Database (11 MB), Bot (Running), OpenAI (Configured), 11 users, 23 moments
- Users: All 11 users with details, filtering, export
- Moments: 23 moments with topics cloud, mood scores, source types
- Analytics: User funnel, cohort retention, registration charts, activity heatmap, language distribution
- Knowledge Base: Upload system ready (currently empty)

### Regression Test Results:
- Feature #51 - Date formatting consistency: PASS
- Feature #27 - Vector search for relevant moments: PASS
- Feature #62 - Data persistence across sessions: PASS
- All systems verified working correctly

## Architecture:
- Telegram bot (Python/aiogram) for positive mindset development
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector embeddings
- Admin panel (Node.js/Express) on port 18088
- APScheduler for notification management
- OpenAI GPT-4o for responses, Whisper for voice

## Project Status:
