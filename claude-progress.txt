## Test Commands

Run individual feature tests:
node test-api.mjs           # Test bot API connection
node test-persistence.mjs   # Test data persistence
node test-history-search.mjs # Test search functionality
node test-negative-mood.mjs # Test mood detection

## Architecture Notes

- Implementation: Node.js with Telegram Bot API
- Data Storage: JSON file (bot-data.json) with schema version 2
- OpenAI Integration: GPT-4 for responses, text-embedding-3-small for vectors
- Whisper: Voice message transcription
- Job Scheduler: APScheduler-like logic for periodic questions
