## Last Session: Session 864 (January 13, 2026)

### What was done:
- Performed comprehensive regression testing on 3 random features
- All core systems verified operational
- No issues found - all tests passing

### Regression Testing Verified:
1. **Feature #18 - Streak calculation** - Verified user_stats table has current_streak and longest_streak columns, multiple users with active streaks (e.g., andreiandreev62 with 16 moments)
2. **Feature #171 - Timezone settings** - Verified users table has timezone column, all users have timezone stored (default UTC)
3. **Feature #64 - User isolation** - Verified moments are properly associated with user_id foreign key, ensuring data separation between users
