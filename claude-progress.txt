# MINDSETHAPPYBOT - Development Progress

## Session 4 Summary (Coding Agent)
**Date**: Session 4 completed
**Status**: Code verification completed, testing still blocked by environment

---

## Session 4 Work

### Environment Status Check
- **Docker**: Installed (version 28.3.2) but Docker Desktop is NOT running
- **Python**: Installed but execution is restricted in current environment
- **PostgreSQL**: Cannot start without Docker Desktop

### Code Verification Completed

Re-verified all components for Feature #1:

#### /start Command Flow:
1. **New User Flow**:
   - `cmd_start()` calls `UserService.get_or_create_user()`
   - Creates user in DB with `telegram_id`, `username`, `first_name`, `language_code`
   - Sends welcome image via `send_welcome_image()` (URL fallback working)
   - Sends localized welcome text via `get_localized_welcome_text()`
   - Shows onboarding keyboard with "На «ты»" / "На «вы»" buttons

2. **Existing User Flow**:
   - `cmd_start()` detects `onboarding_completed=True`
   - Sends welcome back message via `get_localized_welcome_back_text()`
   - Shows main menu keyboard

3. **Onboarding Completion**:
   - User clicks address preference button
   - `callback_address_informal/formal()` updates user settings
   - Calls `UserService.complete_onboarding()` to mark onboarding done
   - Shows explanation text and main menu

#### Localization Support:
- Russian (default): "Привет, {name}!"
- English: "Hello, {name}!"
- Ukrainian: "Привіт, {name}!"

#### Keyboards Verified:
- `get_onboarding_keyboard()` - Address selection during onboarding
- `get_main_menu_keyboard()` - Persistent reply keyboard
- `get_main_menu_inline()` - Inline menu after onboarding
- All other keyboards for settings, moments, etc.

### Unit Tests Status
- 12 unit tests written in `tests/unit/test_commands.py`
- Tests cover:
  - Localization functions for all 3 languages
  - Welcome image sending (success and error cases)
  - New user flow with welcome image
  - Existing user flow without image
  - User name detection
  - Language detection

### Blockers (EXTERNAL - Same as Session 3)

❌ **Cannot verify via actual testing due to:**
1. **Docker Desktop not running** - `error during connect: open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified`
2. **Python execution restricted** - Commands like `python`, `pytest` are blocked
3. **Telegram Bot** - Not testable via browser automation

### Recommendation for Next Session

The code is **fully implemented and ready for testing**. To verify Feature #1:

1. **Start Docker Desktop** on Windows
2. **Enable Python execution** in the environment
3. Run the following sequence:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f /c/Projects/3hours/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   alembic upgrade head
   pytest tests/unit/test_commands.py -v
   ```
4. If unit tests pass, start the bot and test manually in Telegram
5. Mark Feature #1 as passing: `feature_mark_passing(feature_id=1)`

## For Next Session

### CRITICAL: This is a Telegram Bot - NOT a Web App
- **Cannot use browser automation for testing**
- **Requires real Telegram Bot Token from @BotFather**
- **Requires OpenAI API Key for AI features**
- **Requires Docker for PostgreSQL with pgvector**

### To Complete Feature #1:
1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Run `docker compose -f /c/Projects/3hours/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres`
3. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
7. Run unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_commands.py -v`
8. Add real credentials to `.env`:
   - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_real_bot_token (get from @BotFather)
   - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
9. Start the bot: `python -m src.bot.main`
10. Test /start command in Telegram:
    - Send /start to the bot
    - Verify welcome image is shown
    - Verify welcome message includes user's name
    - Verify language is detected correctly
11. Mark feature #1 as passing using `feature_mark_passing(feature_id=1)`

### Testing Checklist for Feature #1:
- [ ] Send /start command to bot
- [ ] Verify welcome message is received
- [ ] Verify welcome image is shown (or fallback if network error)
- [ ] Verify user name is detected from Telegram (shows in greeting)
- [ ] Verify language is detected (test with Russian, English, Ukrainian users)

### Testing Approach for Telegram Bot:
Since browser automation doesn't work for Telegram bots, use these methods:
1. **Manual Testing**: Open Telegram, find the bot, send commands
2. **Unit Tests**: Run `pytest tests/unit/` for function-level testing
3. **Integration Tests**: Connect to real Telegram API with test token
4. **Log Monitoring**: Check bot logs for proper handling

---

## Notes for Future Agents

### IMPORTANT: Telegram Bot Testing
1. **This is NOT a web application** - Browser automation tools won't work
2. **Requires real Telegram token** - Get from @BotFather in Telegram
3. **Requires PostgreSQL with pgvector** - Use Docker or install locally
4. **Test via Telegram app** - Send messages to your bot directly

### Feature Management
1. **Never remove or edit features** - Only mark them as passing
2. **Test thoroughly** - Each feature must work before marking complete
3. **Use real data** - No mock data allowed
4. **Commit often** - Keep progress saved
5. **Update this file** - Add your session's progress

### Current State of Feature #1
- Code is complete and follows all requirements
- Unit tests are written
- Waiting for environment setup to run actual tests
