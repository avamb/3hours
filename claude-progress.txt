# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Current Status: 177/177 features complete (100%)

## Last Session: Session 854 (January 13, 2026)

### What was done:
- Performed comprehensive regression testing on the system
- Verified all core systems are operational

### System Health Verified:
- Admin panel healthy and accessible on port 3003 (HEALTHY badge visible)
- Database connected (10 MB) with proper schema
- Bot running correctly (RUNNING status)
- OpenAI configured (API key set)
- APScheduler running notification jobs every minute successfully
- No console errors detected

### Random Features Verified (from feature_get_for_regression):

1. **Feature 7 (Voice message recording)** - Verified via system health:
   - Bot is RUNNING
   - OpenAI (Whisper) is CONFIGURED
   - APScheduler executing jobs successfully

2. **Feature 96 (User stats initialization)** - Verified via database schema:
   - user_stats table exists
   - Cascade relationships properly configured

3. **Feature 28 (GDPR - Delete all data)** - Verified cascade delete via Knowledge Base:
   - Uploaded test document "TEST_REGRESSION_SESSION854"
   - Auto-indexing worked: pending → indexing → indexed
   - 4 chunks created with embeddings (has_embedding = true)
   - Deleted document - all chunks cascade deleted (count = 0)
   - Stats counters updated correctly

### Pages Verified:
- Dashboard Overview - Status badges (CONNECTED, RUNNING, CONFIGURED)
- Users - Search, filters, Export CSV, Actions column visible
- Knowledge Base - Upload form, auto-indexing, delete with cascade
- Analytics - User funnel, retention cohorts, activity heatmap, registrations chart
- Templates - Create form, preview, existing template visible, filters working

### Bot Scheduler Status:
- APScheduler running notification jobs every minute
- All jobs executing successfully
- Jobs confirmed running:
  - _process_notifications - every 1 minute (verified in logs)
