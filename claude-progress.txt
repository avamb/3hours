## Session 565 - January 13, 2025

### Feature 176 - Auto-index Knowledge Base uploads - VERIFIED PASSING!

Root cause of previous blocker was that the Docker containers were using an old 
invalid API key. Restarting containers picked up the new key from .env.

## Previous Sessions Summary:
- Sessions 534-564: All blocked by invalid OpenAI API key (container had old key)
- Session 565: Identified root cause, restarted containers, verified all ACs passing
- Session 566: Regression testing confirmed all systems working
