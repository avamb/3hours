# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Current Status: 182/182 features complete (100%)

## Last Session: Session 901 (January 14, 2026)

### What was done:
- Performed regression testing on Feature #131 (Admin Dialogs page)
- **FOUND AND FIXED BUG**: The dialogs user endpoint `/api/dialogs/user/:userId` was not implementing message_type and search filters
  - Frontend was sending filter parameters but backend was ignoring them
  - Added dynamic SQL query building with parameterized filters
  - Message type filter now correctly filters by message_type field
  - Search filter now uses ILIKE for case-insensitive text search
- Rebuilt and tested admin container
- Verified both filters work correctly:
  - Message type filter: Selecting "User Response" shows only user_response messages
  - Search filter: Searching "парк" shows only messages containing that text
  - Combined filtering works (e.g., user responses containing "парк")
- Committed fix: `fix(admin): add filtering support to dialogs user endpoint`

### Docker Status:
