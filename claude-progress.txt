# MINDSETHAPPYBOT Progress Notes

## Session 352 - January 10, 2026

### Issue Investigated
Feature #148: "запусти бота; он не отзывается и не работает" (launch the bot; it doesn't respond and doesn't work)

### Root Cause Found
The `docker/entrypoint.sh` script had incorrectly escaped quotes (`\"`) throughout the file. This caused the bash script to fail when the Docker container started, preventing the bot from launching.

### Fix Applied
Fixed all backslash-escaped quotes in `docker/entrypoint.sh`:
- Line 34: `echo \"PostgreSQL is ready!\"` → `echo "PostgreSQL is ready!"`
- Line 38: `echo \"Attempt ...\"` → `echo "Attempt ..."`
- Line 43: `echo \"ERROR: ...\"` → `echo "ERROR: ..."`
- Line 49-51: Fixed migration messages
- Line 55-77: Fixed case statement patterns and all remaining echo statements

### Verification
- Ran `bash -n docker/entrypoint.sh` - syntax check passed
- Committed fix: "Fix entrypoint.sh: remove incorrectly escaped quotes"
- Pushed to dev branch

### Current Status
- Feature #148 is marked as in_progress
- The fix has been pushed to the dev branch
- Dokploy should automatically rebuild and redeploy the container
- After deployment, the bot should start correctly

### Next Steps
1. Wait for Dokploy to redeploy the bot container
2. Test the bot by sending /start command in Telegram
3. If bot responds, mark feature #148 as passing

### Feature Completion
- 147/148 features passing (99.3%)
- Feature #148 pending verification after deployment

### Notes
- The admin panel is accessible at https://3hours.andreevmaster.com
- Admin credentials are set via Dokploy environment variables (not the default .env.example values)
- The bot uses long polling with aiogram 3.x
- PostgreSQL with pgvector is used for storing user data and embeddings
